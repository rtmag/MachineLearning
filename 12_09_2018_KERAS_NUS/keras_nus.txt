#Neural Networks
- "Depth" of a neural network is the number of layers it has.

We can avoid the training plateu by having the "right" architecture of the network.

Deep learning concepts:

-Inputs.
  Set of features to feed into a network. Each feature has a label in deep learning because it is supervised learning.
-Layers
  
-Weights
  Hebb's Rule: If two neurons fire together the synapse between them gets stronger. If two neurons never fire together the connection dies   away.

-Model
  Is already trained.
  A model can be serialized(stored, even compressed), pickled (imported/exported) or retrained.
  
-Parameters
  Weights:
  Bias:

-Hyperparameters
  Number of Layers
  Number of hidden layers
  Iterations
  Learning rate
  Number ofneural units
  Activation function: ReLu for the hidden layers. Sigmoid for TRUE/FALSE classification. Softmax for weight probability soft classification.
